# Rockets in Mechanical Engineering

Information
-----------
This is a model built exclusively in R to model rockets. The flight paths predicted by this model are only applicable for the ascent of a rocket. The goal of this model is to predict the maximum height a rocket with a certain engine will achieve and tries to optimize this height using ballast mass.

Setup
-----
The code has been tested on a Linux (Ubuntu Distro) system. All development was conducted using RStudio. Data was provided by the official manufacturers of the model rocket engines, Estes.
